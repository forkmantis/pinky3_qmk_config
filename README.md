# forkmantis's Pinky3 Keyboard Config #

This repository contains my current configuration for my [Pinky3](https://www.littlekeyboards.com/products/pinky3-keyboard-kit) keyboard.

This is my first keyboard to build and my first split ergo.  It is also the most minimal keyboard I've used, and my first time to use layers.  As a programmer, and a regular user of VIm and the CLI, I have put some thought into the key locations such that I can easily get to the stuff I use the most frequently.  An example is putting the arrow keys on layer 2, but using the same positions as the H, J, K and L keys like VIm.  Layer 1 places the number keys on the home row, w/ the symbols one row above.  A single thumb modifier key makes it easy to access these.

My layout can be found in [this](Pinky3-config.pdf) PDF in this repository.
